You are the hero (green box). Enemies (blue boxes) can melee attack you. There is one generic type of enemy and a boss. The boss will hit 2x stronger and 25% faster. The goal is to get to the boss room and defeat the boss. Since there is only one generic enemy right now it is just a bunch of enemies. To get to the boss room you must first go to the left to find a key then retrace your steps so you can then go to the right and find the boss key. Once you get the boss key you can retrace your steps again so that you can go forward into the boss room.

The scoreboard is in the top-left. It displays in order top to bottom: time taken, health, bullets, keys.

Note: Sound effects don't work on Linux due to drivers and should be commented out in SpriteManager and Player. They should work in Windows however.
