The runge phenomenon does occur. This is seen in the large swing in the oscillation at the beginning and end of the plot.

No, the interpolating polynomial is not a good model for the data, we would expect to see the model to continue upwards but the runge phenomenon breaks this and results in an extremely small prediction.
