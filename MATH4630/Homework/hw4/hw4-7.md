## 7. Choose the best model from amongst the following three: i) that obtained from part 4. above, ii) that obtained from part 5 above, and iii) that obtained from part 6 above.

### Prepare a table similar to Table 3.6 in the book. Also plot the residuals as a function of l for each model. Also plot the residuals as a function of g for each model.

| Model          | $\Sigma[y_i - y(x_i)]^2$ | $Max|y_i - y(x_i)|$ |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| $W=0.0126l^2g$ | 3.3426                   | 1.1708              |
| $W=0.0125l^2g$ | 3.6433                   | 1.3758              |
| $W=0.0187lg^2$ | 17.6548                  | 2.8633              |

### Based on all of this information discuss which model is the "best".

The first model, $W=0.0126l^2g$, is definitely the best. The original model's residuals are not nearly as tight as in the l\*l\*g models. When looking at individual residuals in the l\*l\*g models, the two models trade blows on each girth but the Chebychev model's residuals in totality are still slightly larger.
