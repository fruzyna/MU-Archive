## 4. Code up the expression you derived in 3. above, in any environment you choose, and determine the least-squares estimate of k for the data presented for the derby on the bottom of page 86.  Plot the data and the resulting model fit. Label the graph and the axes. Submit code and graph.

```matlab
% Dermine the least-squares estimate of k and plot

lengths = [14.5 12.5 17.25 14.5 12.625 17.75 14.125 12.615];
girths  = [9.75 8.375 11.0 9.75 8.5 12.5 9.0 8.5];
weights = [27 17 41 26 17 49 23 16];

x = lengths.^2 .* girths;
y = weights;

xy = x .* weights;
x2 = x.^2;

a = sum(xy) / sum(x2)
estW = a .* x;

scatter(estW, weights);
